summary: ICCSE 2019
abstract: "Crowd Science refers to the science that underlies online crowd-powered ecosystems. It focuses on the design and analysis of information processing systems in which humans participate to contribute their intelligence, effort, time and/or resources. In 2016, the first International Conference on Crowd Science and Engineering (ICCSE) was held on the beautiful campus of The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. In 2017, the second ICCSE conference was held on the beautiful campus of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. In 2018, the third ICCSE conference was held on the beautiful campus of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. In 2019, the forth ICCSE conference will be hosted by Shandong University, in Jinan, China. In ICCSE’19, researchers, industry practitioners and policy makers will gather to explore the transformative potential of crowd science research and how to engineer efficient systems that combine the respective strengths of humans and machines to open up new possibilities."
